# This is an example of a controller. We pass in the Config via Dependency
# Injection. A factory creates a shared instance. You can also share objects
# across controllers this way

#FriendRequest Controller (named FR so not to be confused with FriendsRequest as in AppRequest)
angular.module('Friends').factory '_FRController', ->

	class FRController

		constructor: (@$scope, @config, @request, @frModel) ->

			# bind methods on the scope so that you can access them in the
			# controllers child HTML
			@$scope.saveName = (name) =>
				@saveName(name)

			@$scope.acceptFriendshipRequest = (requestor) =>
				@acceptFriendshipRequest(requestor)

			@$scope.createFriendshipRequest = (recipient) =>
				@createFriendshipRequest(recipient)

		#ajax queries

		saveName: (name) ->
			@request.saveName(@config.routes.saveNameRoute, name)

		acceptFriendshipRequest: (friendUid) ->
			@request.acceptFriendshipRequest(@config.routes.acceptFriendshipRequestRoute, friendUid)

		createFriendshipRequest: (recipient) ->
			@request.createFriendshipRequest(@config.routes.createFriendshipRequestRoute, recipient)

	return FRController
